								<p style="text-align:justify; margin-bottom: 1rem;"> Social media data differs from conventional data in many ways. It is not only big, but also noisy, linked, multimodal, and user generated. Unprecedented opportunities thus emerge for researchers in AI through the lens of social media data. In this talk, we use examples to illustrate (1) fundamental problems associated with social media, challenging common practice and existential understanding in machine learning and data mining, (2) intriguing questions, unique to social media, that can be answered by mining social data, and (3) how we can make a difference – that is, contributing to society at large - by developing novel socially responsible AI algorithms in our work on social media mining and AI. There are ample opportunities for interdisciplinary collaborations in AI. We further contemplate the role of social media mining in the rapid development of AI and associated research issues.</p>
