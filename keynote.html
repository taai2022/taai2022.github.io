								<p style="text-align:justify; margin-bottom: 1rem;"> Social media data differs from conventional data in many ways. It is not only big, but also noisy, linked, multimodal, and user generated. Unprecedented opportunities thus emerge for researchers in AI through the lens of social media data. In this talk, we use examples to illustrate (1) fundamental problems associated with social media, challenging common practice and existential understanding in machine learning and data mining, (2) intriguing questions, unique to social media, that can be answered by mining social data, and (3) how we can make a difference – that is, contributing to society at large - by developing novel socially responsible AI algorithms in our work on social media mining and AI. There are ample opportunities for interdisciplinary collaborations in AI. We further contemplate the role of social media mining in the rapid development of AI and associated research issues.</p>

								<p style="text-align:justify; margin-bottom: 1rem;"> It can be said that the future society will have millions of consumers and prosumers interacting each other bi-dictionary. Distributed resources plays important roles for present cities and society in the energy sector, where demand-side resources such as roof-top solar panels and electric vehicles are emerging, and in the logistics sector, where there is a wide range of stakeholders. It is important to utilize those distributed resources by providing incentives to cooperate with each other. This presentation will introduce distributed cooperative social systems and services that also utilize digital technologies such as blockchain and machine learning, while presenting research cases in the fields of peer-to-peer and trading in the electric power sector and logistics.</p>
                                <p style="text-align:justify; margin-bottom: 1rem;"> In this presentation, I will discuss data-driven social system design and its future possibilities. Thus advancement enables us to In this session, we will discuss new distributed cooperative social systems and services that also utilize digital technologies such as blockchain and machine learning, while introducing research cases of peer-to-peer and trading in the power sector and the logistics sector.</p>

								<p style="text-align:justify; margin-bottom: 1rem;"> The recommendation is a technology for suggesting items of interest to users. Under the data-rich but information-poor environment in our society, recommender systems have been playing crucial roles in supporting our efficient information access. While the most successful application domain is e-commerce, recommender systems have the potential to support our daily lives in various ways, such as behavior change support. For such future directions, we think considering users’ personal values in recommendations is important. This talk introduces the framework of modeling users’ personal values as well as introducing it to recommender systems.</p>

								<h5 class="text-center" style="font-weight:bold;">Abstract</h5>
								<p style="text-align:justify; margin-bottom: 1rem;"> Speech is the most important way to communicate for people who speak languages without a standard writing system. There are almost 3000 languages are unwritten languages, and building speech-to-speech translation technology is important to break the language barrier for unwritten language speakers. In this talk, we will walk through the speech-to-speech translation research that Seamless Communication team at Meta AI has developed in the past few years, and how we leverage these learnings to build a speech-to-speech translation system for a real-world language without standard writing systems. We will use English-Taiwanese Hokkien as a case study to present our end-to-end solution from training data collection, and modeling choices to benchmark dataset release.</p>
